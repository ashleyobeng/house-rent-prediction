# house-rent-prediction
This project sought to develop an appropriate predictive model for house rent with the least amount of error based on the features of a house.

In this project, we considered a house rent prediction data set obtained from the kaggle Repository. This data has 12 variables and 4747 observations.There are four numeric variables with the rest being character(categorical) variables. The ‘rent price’ variable was used as the target or response variable while the remaining variables considered as potential predictors.
